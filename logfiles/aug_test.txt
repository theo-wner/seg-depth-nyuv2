General: To Test whether the Augmentations work at all
        --> Becuase using them makes no difference to not using them

                - Trying if augmentations make a difference by using very weird ones
                - Scaling to 5 in every image --> Way too close
                --> iou and rmse are terrible --> Augmentations work in General :)

--> Bug discovered: Cmd Line Arguments werent working properly with bools --> Fixed, now it makes a difference!
